TODO:

On the README of workstation:
- baseboxes link is broken
- Make sure Vagrant's installation instruction isn't ambiguous to the git clone command.
- Clarify where the base directory of the repository is.
- Take care of cases where git isn't installed on the machine
- We need a local server to server the vagrant box. ( Make a script that will edit the Vagrantfile's box url. Also, Ensure that our machines can serve with the correct directory)

uninstall update-manager-core

Create a vim config that is owned by vim, using attributes

Have the nginx cookbook appear, we have already lwrp-ized it :webroot_dir, :user, :port
LWRP-ize the apache2 cookbook

How do we discuss idempotency and why it's important in configuration?
Workstation needs to somehow block login until after the run is complete.
	Possible solution add an execute 'sudo reboot' at the end of the run to see if it will come back up with the GUI
