TODO:

On the README of workstation:
- We need a local server to server the vagrant box. (Ensure that our machines can serve with the correct directory)

- kill the constantly trying to connect network-manager
- Change the wallpaper on the workstation to have an image of where the user is and where that they are running the cookbooks against another node

uninstall update-manager-core
Kill the automatic update popup

Create a vim config that is owned by vim, using attributes
Create tests to test that downloadme is owned by www-data using attributes
Have the nginx cookbook appear, we have already lwrp-ized it :webroot_dir, :user, :port
LWRP-ize the apache2 cookbook

How do we discuss idempotency and why it's important in configuration?
Workstation needs to somehow block login until after the run is complete.
	Possible solution add an execute 'sudo reboot' at the end of the run to see if it will come back up with the GUI

Step-04: Make all templates explicitly owned by user and group root.
Step-05: Change this to an attribute and use www-data or postgres.
Step-06: cookbook_file for replacing an init.d script that lacks a feature by default (status add a something like pid file)

Write a windows batch file to change the Vagrantfile
