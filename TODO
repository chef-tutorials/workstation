TODO:

On the README of workstation:
- We need a local server to server the vagrant box. ( Make a script that will edit the Vagrantfile's box url. Also, Ensure that our machines can serve with the correct directory)


After watching Danni go through the tutorial:
- The test sync-run scripts shouldn't print knife cookbook test outputs (unless it fails)
- step C, make the above shell script (./test-sync...) pass by editing the cookbooks.
- Tell users how to access the chef_node to checkout the outcome.
- Sometimes people don't know that they have to edit apache2 cookbook to make the tests pass. 
- We should also say that vim are examples that works.
- Directory " ______" do action :create end (be more explicit)
- Have to specify that we are running the chef script on another VM.

After watching Derek go through the tutorial:
 - Add more descriptive title for the commit
 - Make the package install vim be explicit with the example

uninstall update-manager-core
Kill the automatic update popup

kill the constantly trying to connect network-manager
Create a vim config that is owned by vim, using attributes
Create tests to test that downloadme is owned by www-data using attributes
Have the nginx cookbook appear, we have already lwrp-ized it :webroot_dir, :user, :port
LWRP-ize the apache2 cookbook

How do we discuss idempotency and why it's important in configuration?
Workstation needs to somehow block login until after the run is complete.
	Possible solution add an execute 'sudo reboot' at the end of the run to see if it will come back up with the GUI
